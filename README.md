🎨 ColorPicker.mnv

A simple web-based color picker tool built with HTML and JavaScript.
This project lets users pick a color from a palette and see its values in various formats.
Ideal for designers, developers, and anyone who needs quick access to color codes.

🧠 Overview

ColorPicker.mnv is a browser-ready color picker interface that allows you to:

Select colors visually

View color codes (e.g., HEX, RGB)

Copy color values for use in designs or code

This is a static frontend project — no backend required.

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML – structure

JavaScript – interactive color picking

CSS (if present) – basic styling

📂 Project Structure
colorpicker.mnv/
├── index.html       # main interface
├── project.js       # JavaScript for color logic
└── (assets/?)       # optional images or styles



🧪 How to Use Locally

Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/Manav-cmd/colorpicker.mnv.git


Open the tool

Go into the project folder

Open index.html in any modern browser
That’s it — no install steps.

🧠 How It Works

Once opened in a browser, the color picker UI allows users to:

✔ Select colors using a graphical palette
✔ See the current color’s HEX and RGB values
✔ Copy codes for use in CSS or design tools


📌 Limitations

Static tool only — no backend or data storage

Color formats depend on the built-in picker logic

Does not generate palettes or export files (unless added)

Be transparent. A simple tool with clear behavior > vague “AI magic.”

🔮 Future Enhancements

To level this project up:

Add RGB/HSB sliders

Show live preview of selected color in UI

Support alpha (opacity) values

Allow exporting selected colors as JSON or CSS
